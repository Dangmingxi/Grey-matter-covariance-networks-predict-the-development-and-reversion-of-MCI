 The code of establishing Random Forest prediction models: "RF_TrainModel.py"
 
 The prediction models of RF were established based on the baseline score maps of the covariance network.
 Fivefold cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted, and the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy.
